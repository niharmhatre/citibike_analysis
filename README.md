The datasets to analyse the data were obtained from [Citibike website](https://citibikenyc.com/) for the year 2018 because the recent datasets donot have the age and gender of the user mentioned. In addition to this I have considered percent of household without personal vehicle and pecente of people using bike for commuting to work in the tracts to see if there is any correlation in the data. 

The Citibike trip data is likely prepared by Lyft, which operates the Citibike bike-sharing service. The trip data is updated on monthly basis and also they have a real-time updates for the docked bikes at the stations.

The main problem I came across was adding a geometry to the datase. I tried to change the name for the heat map in the layer control but could not succeed with it.
